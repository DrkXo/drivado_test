Notes:
1.I have used Provider for state management.
2.Some icons used in this project can be mismatched.
3.In Given instruction there is no BottomNavigation in UserDetails or CompanyDetails page, But
In this scenario i have add these 2 screen under shell route so that it have clear indication
of user navigation and maintaining BottomNavigation.

Full paths for routes:
           └─ (ShellRoute)
             ├─/home (Center)
             ├─/bookings (Center)
             ├─/manage (ManageScreen)
             │ ├─/manage/user (UserDetailsScreen)
             │ └─/manage/company (CompanyDetailsScreen)
             └─/profile (Center)

As I have used go_router for routing management, it can be easily changed if needed.
Initial Route is "/manage (ManageScreen)".



Hiccups:
1. Api's not providing a valid user or other avatar so i have left it blank.
2. Company Api Not providing Sub-Company user emails,So i have randomly generated using faker package.
3. Company api not providing currency for "totalUnpaidBooking" and "availableCreditLimit"
